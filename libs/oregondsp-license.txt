  OregonDSP is a collection of 44 Java classes that design and 
implement finite impulse response (FIR) and infinite impulse response 
(IIR) digital filters.  Supporting classes implement complex and real 
fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) and the overlap-add algorithm for 
filtering a continuous stream in a series of consecutive, contiguous 
blocks with an FIR filter.
